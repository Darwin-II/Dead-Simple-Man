# Dead-Simple-Man
A very simple package manager for Collapse Linux, written entirely in shell script.

DSI is a simple package manager that reads from a list of repositories or directories, and if it finds a change it copies the directory or repository, and compiles and installs what source code it finds there. It then adds the new binaries to its package list and notes down the installed files' locations.

It's dead simple man.
